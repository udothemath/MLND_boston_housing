## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

In this project, we evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

Note: The final write-up is named as report in html format (report_v2 is the final version of the project). The boston_housing is in IPython format. The code visual and visualsMODS are for visualization. The housing is the data file in csv format.
